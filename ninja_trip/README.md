# Ninja Trip

✨ Smooth App Title Animation: Using the TweenAnimationBuilder with the Curves.easeIn property, the app title smoothly transitions into view, adding a polished touch to the user experience.

🦸‍♂️ Dynamic Transitions: Leveraging the Hero class, I’ve created seamless transitions between different screens, ensuring a fluid navigation experience.

❤️ Interactive Heart Animation: Utilizing TweenSequence, the heart icon blinks & turns red when liked, and reverts to normal when unliked, adding a delightful interactive element.

📋 Animated Trip Listing: The trips are displayed using AnimatedList, which brings each trip entry to life with engaging animations.
